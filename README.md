**LT 3991 5V-1.2A Voltage Regulator**

In this design,you will find a DC/DC converter with LT3991.The objective of this design is to convert (max) 55VDC input to 5VDC and supply (max) 1.2A to the output without any decrease in the output voltage.

**LTM8045 - -5V/700mA DC/DC converter**

In this project,you will find a -5V DC/DC converter that can take up to 18VDC input and supply (max) 700 mA.The objective of this project is to investigate low quiescent current use of DC/DC converters.
